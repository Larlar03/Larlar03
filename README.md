### Hello I'm Lana, a Junior Developer with a creative background :sparkles:

- I am self-taught in Front End Development
- I mainly code in HTML, SCSS, JavaScript & React
- I add creativity to my projects through design, like on my <a href="https://vanilla-js-weather.netlify.app" target="_blank">Weather App</a> and <a href="https://lana-gordon-portfolio.netlify.app" target="_blank">Portfolio</a>
- I enjoy adding personality to my projects to make them unique. Check out my <a href="https://roxy-piper-sza-game.netlify.app" target="_blank">Rock, Paper, Scissors</a> spin or my <a href="https://gc-soundboard.netlify.app">GC Soundboard</a>
